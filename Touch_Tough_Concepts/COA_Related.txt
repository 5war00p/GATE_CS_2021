1) Hannessy Patterson - for intuition of cache(library example), virtual memory and pipeline(washing machine).

For cache read till Handling cache misses. You can read section 7.3(Measuring and improving cache performance) as well.

For pipeline, read chapter 6 till hazards.

Expected time to complete is 2–3 days and give it a slow read. Once the analogy sets in you will never forget cache and pipeline.

After this read Chapter 4 from William Stallings for cache. From here you will be able to pick up formulae necessary for solving GATE questions.

For pipeline, attempt the exercises of Carl Hamacher book combined with previous year questions.

Why did I stress more on cache and pipeline is because 60–70% previous year questions are based on these two concepts only.

For rest of the topics(number system,I/o etc), refer to chapter 4 to 9(till arithmetic) from Carl Hamacher book.

Google+ YouTube videos(COA by IIT Madras in nptel) are also helpful to make you understand any concept.

You must stress on solving GATE questions first followed by solving back exercises on your own.

Generally, COA is not taught well but sometimes it can fetch you very easy 4–5 marks.

Best of luck!
